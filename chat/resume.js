My interest in programming began while I was writing my Undergraduate Dissertation which looked at media representation of Hacktivism and Cybersecurity. After graduation, while working as an Operations Assistant, I took the responsibility of automating their review processing system by creating responsive spreadsheets which automatically generated accurate graphs. This made their process faster and eliminated much of the manual data entry. At the same time I was looking into how I could have done this programmatically, and that sparked my desire to fully enter the world of programming.",
